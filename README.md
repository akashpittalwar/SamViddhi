# SamViddhi Task 1 : Teaching Assistant Evaluation
There are two files :
1. Teaching Assistant Model.ipynb : python code for model
2. TA.pdf : PDF of the execution

Conclusion
Successfully performed EDA using tools like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib by handling redundant data.
Successfully Implemented multiclass classification algorithm such as Random Forests Regression.
Successfully optimized hyperparameters using cross-validation.
Successfully Evaluated the trained model on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision,recall, and F1-score.
Finally, the model is saved in the local drive for future evaluation by file name : ['random_forest_model.pkl']
